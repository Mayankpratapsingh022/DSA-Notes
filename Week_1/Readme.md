## Data Structures

Data structures are fundamental components in programming and computer science, enabling efficient data management and manipulation. They can be categorized into two main types:

### Linear

1. **Array**
2. **Tuple**
3. **Linked List**
4. **Stack**
5. **Queue**
6. **Dictionary**

### Non-Linear

1. **Tree**
2. **Graph**
3. **Heap**
4. **Trie**
5. **Hash Table**

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a sequence of finite steps to solve any particular problem. In computer science, algorithms are essential for performing tasks, processing data, and solving complex problems efficiently. They provide a clear set of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a specific goal.

### Why Algorithms Matter:

Algorithms are the backbone of computer programming and software development. They allow us to automate tasks, process large amounts of data, and solve problems that would be impossible to tackle manually. Understanding algorithms is crucial for anyone interested in computer science, as they form the foundation of efficient and effective programming.
