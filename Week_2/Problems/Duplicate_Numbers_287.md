 #Duplicate Numbers
 we'll start with the brute force approach and move on to more efficient algorithms. Let's dive in:

### Approach 1: Brute Force

The brute force approach involves checking every possible pair of elements in the array to see if they are the same.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
for i from 0 to n-1:
    for j from i+1 to n:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            return arr[i]
```

**Explanation:**
1. We iterate through the array using two nested loops.
2. For each element, we compare it with every other element in the array.
3. If a duplicate is found, we return the duplicate element.

**Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)
**Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

### Approach 2: Using a Dictionary (Hash Map)

This approach uses a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each element.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
initialize an empty dictionary
for each element in the array:
    if element is in dictionary:
        return element
    else:
        add element to dictionary with value 1
```

**Explanation:**
1. We initialize an empty dictionary.
2. We iterate through the array.
3. For each element, we check if it is already in the dictionary.
4. If it is, we return that element as the duplicate.
5. If it is not, we add it to the dictionary with a value indicating its frequency.

**Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
**Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)

### Approach 3: Sorting

By sorting the array, duplicate elements will be next to each other, making it easy to find them.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
sort the array
for i from 0 to n-2:
    if arr[i] == arr[i+1]:
        return arr[i]
```

**Explanation:**
1. We sort the array.
2. We iterate through the sorted array.
3. For each element, we check if it is equal to the next element.
4. If it is, we return that element as the duplicate.

**Time Complexity:** \(O(n \log n)\)
**Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) to \(O(n)\)

### Approach 4: Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection)

This approach is based on the cycle detection algorithm, which uses two pointers moving at different speeds to detect a cycle.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
initialize slow and fast pointers to the start of the array

# Part 1: Finding the meeting point
while True:
    slow = arr[slow]
    fast = arr[arr[fast]]
    if slow == fast:
        break

# Part 2: Finding the entrance to the cycle
slow = arr[0]
while slow != fast:
    slow = arr[slow]
    fast = arr[fast]

return slow
```

**Explanation:**
1. We initialize two pointers, slow and fast, at the start of the array.
2. We move the slow pointer by one step and the fast pointer by two steps in each iteration.
3. When the slow pointer equals the fast pointer, a cycle is detected.
4. To find the entrance of the cycle (the duplicate element), we reset the slow pointer to the start of the array.
5. We move both pointers one step at a time until they meet again. The meeting point is the duplicate element.

**Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
**Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)

### Detailed Explanation with Code

Let's break down the code for Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm line by line:

```python
def find_duplicate(nums):
    # Initialize the slow and fast pointers to the start of the array
    slow = nums[0]
    fast = nums[0]
    
    # Part 1: Finding the meeting point
    while True:
        slow = nums[slow]       # Move slow pointer one step
        fast = nums[nums[fast]] # Move fast pointer two steps
        if slow == fast:        # Check if both pointers meet
            break
    
    # Part 2: Finding the entrance to the cycle
    slow = nums[0]               # Reset slow pointer to the start of the array
    while slow != fast:          # Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet
        slow = nums[slow]        # Move slow pointer one step
        fast = nums[fast]        # Move fast pointer one step
    
    return slow                  # The meeting point is the duplicate element
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Initialization:**
   - Both `slow` and `fast` pointers are initialized to the first element of the array.
2. **Finding the Meeting Point:**
   - We use a `while` loop to move the `slow` pointer by one step and the `fast` pointer by two steps.
   - The loop continues until the `slow` pointer equals the `fast` pointer, indicating a cycle.
3. **Finding the Entrance to the Cycle:**
   - The `slow` pointer is reset to the start of the array.
   - Both `slow` and `fast` pointers are moved one step at a time until they meet.
   - The meeting point is the duplicate element.

By following these steps and understanding the code, you can efficiently find the duplicate number in an array with \(O(n)\) time complexity and \(O(1)\) space complexity.
