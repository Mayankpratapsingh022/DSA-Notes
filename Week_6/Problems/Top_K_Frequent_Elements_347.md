# Top K Frequent Elements 347
### Problem Breakdown

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, we need to return the `k` most frequent elements in the array.

### Example

- Input: `nums = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `[1, 2]`

In this example, the element `1` appears 3 times, `2` appears 2 times, and `3` appears once. Since `k = 2`, we return the top 2 most frequent elements, which are `1` and `2`.

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Count the Frequency of Each Element**:
   - We use a dictionary or `Counter` from the `collections` module to count how often each element appears in the `nums` array.

2. **Use a Heap to Find the Top k Frequent Elements**:
   - Once we have the frequency of each element, we can use a max heap (or, more commonly in Python, we use `heapq.nlargest` which internally uses a heap) to extract the `k` elements with the highest frequency.

### Code Explanation

Let's go through the provided solution code step by step:

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # Base case: if k is equal to the length of nums, then all elements are equally frequent
        if k == len(nums):
            return nums
        
        # Step 1: Create a dictionary where keys are the unique elements in nums
        # and values are the frequency of those elements.
        dict1 = Counter(nums)
        
        # Step 2: Use heapq.nlargest to get the top k keys with the highest frequency.
        # The nlargest function is passed the number k, the iterable dict1.keys(),
        # and a key function dict1.get to fetch the frequency (value) for each key.
        return heapq.nlargest(k, dict1.keys(), key=dict1.get)
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation

1. **`from collections import Counter`**:
   - We import `Counter` from the `collections` module. `Counter` is a subclass of `dict` that is specifically designed to count hashable objects.

2. **`import heapq`**:
   - We import the `heapq` module, which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm (also known as the priority queue algorithm).

3. **`class Solution:`**:
   - We define a class `Solution` where the method `topKFrequent` will be implemented.

4. **`def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:`**:
   - This is the method definition that takes in a list `nums` and an integer `k`, and returns a list of the `k` most frequent elements.

5. **`if k == len(nums): return nums`**:
   - This is a base case check. If `k` is equal to the length of `nums`, it means we want all elements, so we can directly return `nums` as is.

6. **`dict1 = Counter(nums)`**:
   - Here, we use `Counter` to create a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements in `nums`, and the values are the counts of how often each element appears.

7. **`return heapq.nlargest(k, dict1.keys(), key=dict1.get)`**:
   - `heapq.nlargest(k, dict1.keys(), key=dict1.get)` is used to find the top `k` elements with the highest frequency.
   - `k`: The number of elements we want.
   - `dict1.keys()`: The keys (unique elements) of the dictionary.
   - `key=dict1.get`: A function that retrieves the frequency of each key from the dictionary.

   This line finds the `k` elements with the largest frequency values and returns them as a list.

### Summary

The approach leverages counting frequencies with a dictionary and then efficiently finding the top `k` elements using a heap. This approach is more efficient than sorting the entire frequency list, making it suitable for larger datasets. The time complexity of this solution is `O(n log k)`, which is better than the `O(n log n)` required to fully sort the elements.
